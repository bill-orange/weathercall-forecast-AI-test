This project combines the use of OpenAI with OpenWeatherMap.  There can be a considerable time gap between the
curent weather report and the forecast weather report when using the OpenWeahterMap free API.  This project 
"fills in the gaps" by consulting OpenAI.  So far, It seems to do a pretty good job. 
This project uses the Cheap Yellow Display (CYD).  You will need a free OpenWeatherMap key and an OpenAI key.
